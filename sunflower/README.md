# Sunflower Animation

This mini project was inspired from CSS Blossoming Flowers at Magical Night by Md Usman Ansari. If you want to see his work, you can check this [link](https://codepen.io/mdusmanansari/pen/BamepLe).

For a little background, the sunflower is an icon of my university's graduation. It's a symbol of new hopes and dreams as students graduate. Before our first onsite classes started after the pandemic, I coded this as a reminder that we can fully blossom despite the uncertainties that the last semester may bring. I gave this to a good friend as a gratitude and reminder that we can get that _Sablay_ and graduate victoriously that year.
